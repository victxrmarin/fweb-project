            <h1>The Scream</h1>
            <p>The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the
                piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur
                (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in
                art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a
                formative influence on the Expressionist movement.</p>
